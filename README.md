## TransitApp - A collaboration between Front End Engineering and Ruby on Rails classes.

This project is based on TransitScreen by utilizing WMATA and Capital Bikeshare API's.  Users can view the train arrival times of the closet station and bike availability of the 3 closes bike stations.  This is the front end part of the project using AJAX, handlebars, and geolocation.

The back end portion can be view here: https://github.com/MarkHyland/transit_app
